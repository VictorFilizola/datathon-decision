Of course. This is an excellent, comprehensive plan. Let's organize it into a clear, actionable project roadmap with three distinct phases: **Offline Training**, **Online Application**, and **Deployment & Monitoring**.

This structure will help you focus on one part of the problem at a time.

---

### ## Phase 1: Data Processing & Model Training (Offline)

**Goal:** To create a reliable predictive model based on historical data.

* **Step 1: LLM-Powered Feature Extraction**
    * **Action:** Write a Python script (`process_applicants.py`).
    * **Task:** This script will iterate through every candidate in `applicants.json`. For each one, it will call an LLM API with a precise prompt to extract skills, inferred seniority, and language proficiency from the `cv_pt` field.
    * **Output:** A new file, `applicants_llm_features.json`. This file is your **cached, structured data**, saving you from making repeated API calls.

* **Step 2: Create the Master Training Dataset**
    * **Action:** Write a data preparation script (`build_dataset.py`).
    * **Task:**
        1.  Load `prospects.json`, `vagas.json`, and your new `applicants_llm_features.json`.
        2.  Merge them into a single, flat table, linking candidates to the jobs they applied for.
        3.  Engineer the target variable `match_sucesso` (1 for 'Contratado', 0 for 'Não Aprovado', etc.).
    * **Output:** A clean CSV file, `master_training_data.csv`.

* **Step 3: Train the Predictive Model**
    * **Action:** Create a training script (`train.py`).
    * **Task:** Load `master_training_data.csv`, split it into training and testing sets, train a classifier (like XGBoost or RandomForest), and evaluate its performance.
    * **Output:** A serialized model file (e.g., `model_v1.pkl`) and a performance report (`model_card_v1.md`).

* **Step 4: Evaluate and Benchmark**
    * **Action:** Manual and automated analysis.
    * **Task:**
        1.  Check the model's metrics (Precision, Recall, AUC) from the test set.
        2.  **Crucially**, manually review a few dozen predictions. Look at high-probability and low-probability candidates. Does the model's reasoning make sense? This step is vital for building trust and finding hidden biases.

### ## Phase 2: API & Application Development (Online)

**Goal:** To build the tools to use your model and retrain it.

* **Step 5: Build the Backend API (FastAPI)**
    * **Action:** Create the main application file (`main.py`).
    * **Task:** Implement the following endpoints:
        * `POST /predict`: Receives new candidate data, calls the LLM for feature extraction, feeds the result to the loaded `.pkl` model, and returns the prediction.
        * `POST /train`: A powerful endpoint that triggers your entire offline pipeline (`process_applicants.py`, `build_dataset.py`, `train.py`) to create a new, updated model.
        * `GET /models`: Lists all available model files (`model_v1.pkl`, `model_v2.pkl`) and their performance metrics from the model cards.

* **Step 6: Create the Simple Frontend**
    * **Action:** Use a simple framework like Streamlit or Gradio (`app.py`).
    * **Task:** Create a user interface with:
        1.  A form to submit a new candidate's JSON data and select a model.
        2.  A "Predict" button that calls your `/predict` API.
        3.  A "Train New Model" button that calls your `/train` API.
        4.  A section to display the prediction results.

### ## Phase 3: Deployment & Monitoring

**Goal:** To package the project and monitor its performance in real-time.

* **Step 7: Implement Logging**
    * **Action:** Modify the `/predict` endpoint in `main.py`.
    * **Task:** For every prediction made, save the key information (input features, LLM output, final prediction, timestamp) to a local SQLite database (`logs.db`).

* **Step 8: Create Monitoring Dashboard**
    * **Action:** Create a separate dashboard script (`dashboard.py`).
    * **Task:** Use Streamlit or Dash to read from `logs.db` and visualize key operational metrics, such as prediction volume over time and the distribution of skills in incoming candidates. This helps you spot data drift.

* **Step 9: Dockerize the Project**
    * **Action:** Create a `Dockerfile` in your project's root directory.
    * **Task:** Write the instructions to package your entire application—the FastAPI server, all your scripts, model files, and dependencies—into a self-contained, portable container. This is the final step for a truly professional MLOps project.
